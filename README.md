# The Veronique's Stack

***We Believe, Every Piece of Jewerly Tells a Radiant Story.***

VR is a boilerplate that ready-to-use for production.
And its using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) â€” Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. 

We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development.

## Motivation

The motivation behind making this project is to standardize and make it easier to create applications with complex features, by using this project we hope to get it done faster.

## Pre-requisite

To be able to run this project, several supporting tools are needed, such as:

- Web server i.e: `xampp`, `lampp` or `mapp`
- Core language `php ^8.x`
- JavaScript runtime like `Node Js`
- Package manager for `composer` 

## Run development mode

1. Clone this project: `git clone https://github.com/wearevero/VR.git`

2. Open **double** `bash` in the VR directory: one to run node js the other to run composer engine.

3. Install all required php dependencies with the command `composer install --ignore-platform-req=ext-gd` and... wait for the apocalypse, just kidding.

4. On another `bash`, run the command `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install the dependencies related to the required assets.

5. Generate key `php artisan key:generate`

6. Make database

7. Copying environment example `cp .env.example .env`

8. Running migration `php artisan migrate`

9. Seed default data `php artisan db:seed`

10. Checking the health? `php artisan health:check`

11. Take a look on your browser at: `127.0.0.1:8000`

## Run the testing

Upsss... there's not testing library to this project.

## Run for production
1. Install autoloader optimization `composer require --optimize-autoloader --ignore-platform-req=ext-gd`

2. Let's optimize it! `php artisan optimize`
